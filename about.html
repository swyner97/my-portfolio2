        <p><span> Sarah Wyner</span> (wheyenr) (she/they), born in America, half Filipino and half Lithuanian (100% indulges in bad assery), is a web designer based in California. She just started her coding journey not too long ago, in December but is already learning a ton. She is dedicated to the trade, spending hours and hours a day, up to 30+ hours a week, to heighten her skill. Her ultimate goal is to become a full-stack web developer with an awesome company that supports their employees. She loves to take on side projects and helping small businesses grow. Currently, she is working on a new site for a dental clinic in Philippines, stay tuned for that! 
            <br><br>
            Sarah graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 2020 with a bachelors degree in Philosophy and is currently in the full-stack bootcamp at UC Los Angeles. During her downtime, she trains for marathons, knits, and reads. She also goes to the theatre with her wife, Rachel, almost every week!</p>
