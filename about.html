            <p><span> Sarah Wyner</span> (wheyenr) (she/they), born in America, half Filipino and half Lithuanian (100%
                indulges in bad assery), is a web designer based in California. She just started her coding journey not
                too long ago, in December but is already learning a ton. She is dedicated to the trade, spending hours
                and hours a day, up to 30+ hours a week, to heighten her skill. Her ultimate goal is to become a
                full-stack web developer with an awesome company that supports their employees. She loves to take on
                side projects and helping small businesses grow. Currently, she is working on a new site for a dental
                clinic in Philippines, stay tuned for that!
                <br><br>
                Sarah graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 2020 with a bachelors degree in Philosophy and is currently in
                the full-stack bootcamp at UC Los Angeles. During her downtime, she trains for marathons, knits, and
                reads. She also goes to the theatre with her wife, Rachel, almost every week!
